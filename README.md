Brief Introduction and backgroud

As an important resource of information for specifying video content, the title keywords of video have a strong impact on the playback amount of that video. Although there is a great theoretical and practical value, the techniques of playback amount prediction through keywords analysis are not mature and their researches are not yet in-depth. Based on the average weekly playback amount of a short video, it is classified as popular video or non-popular video. 

Therefore, the playback prediction problem is studied as a classification problem. Through building a logistic regression model and utilizing the counting matrix of title keywords as independent variable, this thesis tries to predict the possibility of a video including some specific keywords becoming a popular video. The results show that the prediction accuracy of trained model is more than 70%, and the average AUC value by cross validation is more than 0.74, which is based on 5000 short videos related data from Tencent, Weibo, Tencent and Wechat. 

These results show that the model has high reliability and stability, and this method is also a feasible way to predict the amount of video playback.
